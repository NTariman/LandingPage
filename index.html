         <p class="hero-description">
            Mushrooms are sensitive and a small change in their environment can lead to mold, bacteria, or unwanted
            odors that ruin a harvest. FreshSense uses smell-detection technology and smart software to monitor air
            inside grow rooms and spot early signs of trouble. When something unusual appears, the system sends quick
            alerts so farmers can act before visible damage spreads—protecting crops, time, and income.

            <h2 class="section-title">What is FreshSense?</h2>
            <p class="section-text">FreshSense is a simple, easy-to-use system that “smells” the air inside mushroom
               farms. Imagine a small device, about the size of your hand, quietly working in the corner of a grow room.
               It reads the air every second, looking for unusual odors that may signal problems such as mold, bad
               bacteria, or issues with the growing material. Once FreshSense detects something unusual, it sends a
               quick alert to the farmer’s phone. This means the farmer can take action right away—long before the
               problem becomes visible. FreshSense acts like a “nose that never sleeps,” helping farmers protect their
               harvest 24 hours a day.</p>

            <h3 class="section-title">Why Smell Matters in Mushroom Farming</h3>
            <p class="section-text">Most mushroom problems start quietly. Before mold becomes green, or before bacteria
               spreads, they release tiny smells that humans cannot notice. These smells show up hours or even days
               before any visible signs appear. Farmers usually discover problems when it’s too late—when mushrooms look
               sick, when the trays turn strange colors, or when the room begins to smell odd. At this point, the
               contamination has already spread. FreshSense solves this by detecting early smells that are invisible and
               impossible to notice without technology. It gives farmers a “head start,” allowing them to stop problems
               early and save most—or even all—of the harvest.</p>

      <section class="how-it-works">
         <div class="section-content container">
            <h2 class="section-title">How FreshSense Works</h2>
            <p class="section-text">FreshSense is made up of two main parts:</p>
            <ol class="features-list">
               <li class="feature-item">
                  <h3 class="feature-title">A Smart Odor Sensor</h3>
                  <p class="feature-description">This is the small device placed in mushroom growing rooms. It checks
                     the air for certain smells that are known to be early signs of trouble. It doesn’t need water,
                     sunlight, or complicated setup—just place it and turn it on.</p>
               </li>
               <li class="feature-item">
                  <h3 class="feature-title">A Mobile App for Farmers</h3>
                  <p class="feature-description">The app shows what FreshSense is detecting. If the air is clean and
                     healthy, everything will appear green. If something unusual starts to happen, the app changes color
                     and sends messages like:</p>
                  <ul class="alerts-list">
                     <li>Warning: Possible mold activity in Room 2.</li>
                     <li>Alert: Air quality changing—check humidity or ventilation.</li>
                  </ul>
               </li>
            </ol>
            <p class="section-text">Farmers can then act quickly by adjusting temperature, cleaning a tray, improving
               airflow, or removing infected spots. Everything is designed to be easy to understand so any farmer, no
               matter their background, can use it comfortably.</p>

            <ul class="benefits-list">
               <li>Prevents crop loss. A single contamination can destroy 30–70% of the harvest. FreshSense alerts
                  farmers early, giving them time to fix the issue and save their crops.</li>
               <li>Saves money. Losing a harvest is expensive. FreshSense protects farms from costly damage by keeping
                  the environment stable and safe.</li>
               <li>Reduces stress. Farmers no longer need to constantly check and worry. FreshSense watches over the
                  farm 24/7.</li>
               <li>Improves mushroom quality. Healthy mushrooms grow better, look better, and sell at a higher price.
               </li>
               <li>Helps small and big farms. FreshSense works for backyard growers, mid-sized farms, and large
                  commercial operations.</li>

            <h2 class="section-title">A Simple Tool With a Big Impact</h2>
            <p class="section-text">Whether the farm is small or large, FreshSense brings modern protection that used to
               be available only in expensive laboratories. Instead of reacting only when something looks wrong,
               FreshSense helps farmers act early—before the damage spreads. The goal is simple: give every mushroom
               farm the chance to run smoothly and successfully. With FreshSense, farmers gain:</p>
            <ul class="impact-list">
               <li>Better harvest consistency</li>
               <li>Cleaner grow rooms</li>
               <li>Fewer disease outbreaks</li>
               <li>More confidence every growing cycle</li>
               <li>Higher income and lower waste</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="section-text">FreshSense is not just another sensor. It is built specifically for mushroom farms.
               Traditional farm sensors only measure temperature and humidity. FreshSense goes beyond that by focusing
               on smell, which is the earliest sign of contamination. Other tools detect problems late—FreshSense
               detects them early. That difference means the farmer has time to react, save the harvest, and prevent
               bigger losses.</p>
